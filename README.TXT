This is a fork of the "raspi-config" program.

The purpose of this program is to add new functionality
to the program specifially for the PiBang Linux distribution.

Our hopes are that after testing here, changes will make their
way upstream to the original program and that both programs can
stay very close in their innerworkings.

It is re-released under the same liscence as it was orriginally
written under.
